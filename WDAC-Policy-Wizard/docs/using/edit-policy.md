# Editing an Existing App Control Policy

This document outlines the steps to edit an exisiting base or supplemental App Control policy. This tool enables users to edit the policy rules, 
its signing rules and its attributes. 

The [official App Control documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/wdac-wizard-editing-policy) outlines the edit policy steps. 

## 1. Select the Policy Editor from the start menu ##

Using the Browse button, navigate to the App Control policy you would like to edit. The policy Wizard will verify that the policy exists. Once the validation is complete, 
you can rename the policy and edit the policy ID by editing the values in the textboxes. 


## 2. Configure the policy rule options ##

The policy rule options will be automatically enabled/disabled based on the policy you are editing. You can edit the desired policy rule options by pressing 
the slider button next to the policy rule titles. A toggled rule option will appear in the CI policy while a toggled-off option will not. 

Hovering the mouse over the policy rule names will display a short description of the ruleat the bottom of the page. More information about each of the policy rules 
can be located at the [App Control policy rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/select-types-of-rules-to-create#windows-defender-application-control-policy-rules)
page. 

Selecting the `+ Advanced Options` button will reveal the advanced policy rule options panel. This grouping of rules contains additional policy rule options which are less common 
to a majority of users. 

We recommend leaving the **Audit Mode** policy rule option enabled until users have sufficiently understood how the policy and signing rules will affect their scenario. 
Disabling Audit Mode will result in the policy running in enforced mode after the policy is deployed. For more information on deploying App Control policies see [Deploying App Control Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control-deployment-guide). 

## 3. Creating policy signing rules ## 

The Signing Rules List on the left-hand side of the page show the pre-exisiting signing rules of the existing policy,as well as any associated files and exceptions. At this point, 
you may choose to add custom rules to the policy and delete select rules. 

#### Creating Custom Signing Rules ####

Selecting the `+ Custom Rules` button will open the Custom Rules panel. Four types of custom rules conditions can be defined. 

| Rule Condition | Usage Scenario | 
| - | - |
| Publisher | To use a publisher condition, the files must be digitally signed by the software publisher, or you must do so by using an internal certificate. |
| File Path | Any file can be assigned this rule condition; however, because path rules specify locations within the file system, any subdirectory will also be affected by the rule (unless explicitly exempted).|
| Folder Path | Any folder can be assigned this rule condition; .|
| File Hash | Any file can be assigned this rule condition; however, the rule must be updated each time a new version of the file is released because the hash value is based in part upon the version.|

  1. **Publisher Rules** - select the Publisher option from the Rule Type combobox. Next choose to Allow or Deny the publisher, and select a reference file signed by the software publisher off which to base the rule. 
  By default, the publisher is set to apply to all files signed by the publisher, with the specific product name and file name with a version at or above the one specified. The restrictiveness of the rule can be modified using the slider. 
  The text below the slider documents outlines the how the rule will be interpreted. 
  
  The table below shows the relationship between the slider placement, the corresponding App Control rule level and its description. 
  
  | Rule Condition | App Control Rule Level | Description |
  | - | - | - |
  | **Publisher** | FilePublisher | Combination of the file name, PCA cert with CN of the leaf, and the minimum version number. |
  | **Product name** | FilePublisher | Combination of the file name, PCA cert with CN of the leaf, and the minimum version number. |
  | **File name** | FilePublisher | Combination of the file name, PCA cert with CN of the leaf, and the minimum version number. |
  | **Version** | FilePublisher | Combination of the file name, PCA cert with CN of the leaf, and the minimum version number. |

  2. **Path Rules** - select the Path option from the Rule Type combobox. Next choose to Allow or Deny the path, and select either a File or Folder rule using the radiobutton below the Browse button. Lastly, select the reference file
  or folder off which to base the rule. 
  
  3. **Hash Rules** - select the File Hash option from the Rule Type combobox. Next choose to Allow or Deny the hash, and select the file off which to base the rule. 
  
#### Deleting Signing Rules ####
  
Template signing rules and custom rules can be deleted from the policy by selecting the rule from the rules list dataviewer. Once the rule is highlighted, selecting the delete button underneath the table will prompt for additional confirmation. Select `Yes` to remove the rule from the policy and the rules table. 


## 4. Building the policy ##

The policy build page will monitor the progress of the App Control policy creation process. Depending on the number and complexity of the custom signing rules, the build process
could take several minutes. 

Once the build process is complete, selecting the policy path link will open the policy XML file for review. The binary file is also written to the same path for manual 
deployment. Steps for manual deployment can be reviewed here [Deploying App Control Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control-deployment-guide). 
To create another policy, edit an exisiting policy or merge two or more policies, select the home button to continue.
